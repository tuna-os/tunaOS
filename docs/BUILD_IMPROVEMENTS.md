# Build System Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the TunaOS build system and CI/CD pipeline.

## Shell Script Fixes

### Issues Fixed:
- **Shebang positioning**: Fixed improper shebang placement in `pixi.sh`
- **Unused variables**: Removed unused `CONTEXT_PATH`, `BUILD_SCRIPTS_PATH`, and `OLD_PRETTY_NAME` variables from build scripts
- **Quoting issues**: Added proper quoting in script paths and variables
- **Error handling**: Improved error handling with `set -euo pipefail`

### Impact:
- All critical shellcheck errors resolved
- More robust script execution
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

## Justfile Improvements

### Changes Made:
1. **Better documentation**: Added comprehensive header comments and parameter descriptions
2. **Simplified aliases**: Removed redundant aliases like `rebuild-vm`
3. **Improved grouping**: Better organization of recipes into logical groups
4. **Enhanced error handling**: Added proper error handling in all scripts
5. **Cleaner syntax**: Improved formatting and consistency

### New Organization:
- **Just**: Syntax checking and formatting
- **Utility**: Cleanup and helper functions
- **Virtual Machine Images**: Building VM images (qcow2, raw, iso)
- **Virtual Machine**: Running built VMs
- **Advanced**: Advanced/debugging features

## CI/CD Workflow Improvements

### Recent Enhancements:
1. **Multiplatform Manifest Verification**: Added comprehensive verification jobs that ensure all intended platforms are present in container manifests before proceeding to the next build stage
2. **Build Pipeline Coordination**: Enhanced job dependencies to ensure proper sequencing (base → dx → gdx) with verification gates
3. **Error Reporting**: Clear status reporting when manifest verification fails or succeeds
4. **Platform Safety**: "latest" tags are only applied after successful manifest verification

### Proposed Changes:
1. **Unified workflow**: Replace three separate workflows with one consolidated workflow
2. **Matrix-based builds**: Use proper matrix strategy for different variants
3. **Central configuration**: Move branch/platform configuration to a single YAML file
4. **Composite actions**: Create reusable actions for common setup steps
5. **Simplified logic**: Reduce complex conditional expressions

### Benefits:
- Easier maintenance
- Reduced duplication
- Better readability
- More flexible variant building
- **Enhanced reliability**: Multiplatform manifests are verified before progression
- **Early failure detection**: Platform-specific issues caught immediately

## Build Optimizations

### Performance Improvements:
- **Conditional rechunking**: Only rechunk for non-PR builds
- **Better error handling**: Fail fast with clear error messages
- **Optimized clean operations**: More robust cleanup with error handling

### Security Enhancements:
- **Maintained signing**: All existing security features preserved
- **SBOM generation**: Continues to work with improved workflow
- **Proper secret handling**: No changes to security model

## Usage Examples

### Basic building:
```bash
# Build standard image
just build

# Build with DX features
just build yellowfin latest 1 0

# Build and test locally with rechunking
just local-build
```

### VM operations:
```bash
# Build and run QCOW2 VM
just build-vm
just run-vm

# Use systemd-vmspawn instead of QEMU
just spawn-vm
```

### Development workflow:
```bash
# Check all syntax
just check

# Format all files
just fix

# Lint shell scripts
just lint

# Clean build artifacts
just clean
```

## Migration Guide

### For Developers:
- Most existing commands work the same
- Some aliases removed but main commands preserved
- Better documentation available with `just --list`

### For CI/CD:
- New unified workflow provides same functionality
- Matrix-based approach allows more flexible builds
- Central configuration makes updates easier

These improvements maintain full backward compatibility while providing a cleaner, more maintainable build system.
