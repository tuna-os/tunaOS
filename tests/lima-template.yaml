# Lima configuration for TunaOS Testing
# This file is a template. The placeholder __IMAGE_PATH__ will be replaced by the test script.

images:
  # location is the absolute path to the qcow2 image
  - location: "__IMAGE_PATH__"
    arch: "__ARCH__"

# Enable VNC
video:
  display: "vnc"

# Use the default user 'centos' with password 'centos' (as defined in build-bootc-diskimage.sh)
# Lima will try to inject its own keys, but since we are booting a pre-built image 
# without cloud-init (unless we add it), we rely on the baked-in credentials or 
# if the image has cloud-init enabled, lima can handle it. 
# Our current bootc build might not have cloud-init fully set up for Lima, 
# so we might need to rely on the console/VNC or SSH if keys are injected.
# For now, we assume the user will log in via VNC or SSH if configured.

# SSH Configuration
# We attempt to rely on standard Lima key injection if cloud-init is present.
# If not, 'limactl shell' might fail to connect automatically, but the VM will run.
